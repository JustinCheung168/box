TODO PRIOR TO MEETING:
-Review technical career path
-Review timeline concern
-Call UC Berkeley to see if there is any part-time Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering option
-See what Purdue, UIUC, CMU, UMich Ann Arbor, TAMU; for reach, Cal, Stanford, CalTech have
-Review JHU vs GAtech curriculums to see how to choose one or another for ECE
-Look at JHU MS EE more to see what coursework I would hypothetically take

-Review JHU and GAtech payment schemes, acceptance requirements, curriculum, course offerings, etc.

-Note: GA Tech 1.1k per credit


Why I am interested in both:
	The engineering master’s side?
-Want to continue education in electrical engineering topics (signal processing, ML, etc.) as I had focused on in undergrad, while also getting a stronger background in computer engineering to become a more well-rounded software engineer with context of the greater system.
	-Especially interested in theoretical background that may be difficult to pick up on job, but that would make me a key contributor in the company too. So stronger focus on stuff like signal processing and ML theory, and less on software packages that I already know how to use/have experience with, or could figure out on my own.
	-Johns Hopkins MS EE currently looks great, still exploring other schools
-I want to be as well-equipped as I can be in terms of technical knowledge for technical leadership
-I love learning, especially in engineering; loved my undergrad coursework, A-Course was a big part of why I wanted to do Edison, and I feel certain that I want to continue getting formal education.
-I hope some of the things I learn in a master’s degree will pair well with what I am able to learn internally at GE.
	The clinical immersion certificate?
		-On the personal passion side - 
-I missed a huge opportunity to explore this side while I was in undergrad; I tried to volunteer in hospitals and do biomedical research, but still feel like I’m missing a lot of context that could make me a better engineer in the biomedical space.
-Have always wanted to at least try out a patient-facing role where I can provide meaningful care. Would feel like I have a much better understanding of what that looks like, and where I can make my impact, if I do this training.
-Have had a long-standing passion in working in both the clinical space and in electrical engineering/its related subtopics. I always felt most satisfied with projects that had a clear positive impact on people. However, I always felt like I did not know as much about what is needed in the medical space as I want to, and want to develop my skills of needs finding, understanding how clinics work, understand how to speak a common language with clinicians, how to better empathize with both clinicians and patients, etc.
		-On the career growth side -
-I think it will be important for my future as a technical leader to be well aware of what our customers need, and to have that inform decisions I make about features or subsystems or products.
-I also think the practice with interfacing with clinicians and patients will help me communicate better/be more empathetic to needs, which will make me both a better leader in the future as well as a better employee in any role.
-Obviously, being better versed in the healthcare space in any form will give me better domain knowledge at GE HealthCare.


Misc. neutral thoughts:
	-Want to hold off on deciding what to get a master’s degree in until after I can experience what I came to experience in A-Course; that way I can specialize in something with even more knowledge and practical experience backing up that passion.
	-My ideal master’s degree (pending further experiences that help shape this vision better) lets me get stronger electrical engineering fundamentals in a similar way to how Rice shaped its electrical engineering degree, or how schools like UC Berkeley structure their EECS programs - I want the signal processing and machine learning side, and any math and statistics that supports that.
		-From a personal passion side, that’s what I’m most interested in academically and I love going the extra mile to understand it better. Was a TA, made desmos tools to help students understand stuff, etc.
		-From a career/GE standpoint, as you know those topics have applications everywhere in the company. Air Recon DL, other DL applications around the business (AIRx, new MR innovation topic for hardware optimization via shallow ML, etc.)
		-If they offered a part-time program, UC Berkeley EECS would be ideal to me - something that would help me build up the computer science fundamentals which I think I need most for future software work, while also still continuing learning in those EE-focused software topics.
	-JHU vs GAtech?
		-Both highly reputable
		-JHU has smaller class size

Questions about whether this plan makes sense:
-Do you have any hesitations about my personal reasons?
-Would GE see a good business reason to support these goals?


Questions about C-Course logistics:
-Would GE pay for both?
-Timeline? 
-Retention clause - to confirm since other members of class also found it unclear, does that apply to the 2022 class? (From perspective of making sure it’s something I can do without unintentionally stepping into debt if I need to support my family etc.)
-Likewise, full payment up-front?
-Is thesis master’s supported? Research in general? GE support for future PhD?
-How did Johns Hopkins relationship start? Did their online master’s already exist? What existing infrastructure for online/part-time master’s would need to already exist at the school of interest for them and GE to be interested in entering talks?
